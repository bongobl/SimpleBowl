This is the Working version of SimpleBowl, a bowling API that allows for users to design a bowling game without worrying about all the scorekeeping logistics. The user simply specifies the number of pins knocked down for each throw and SimpleBowl takes care of the rest including score keeping, handling spares and strikes, and determining when the game is over along with the final score.
